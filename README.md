# feynman
A javascript application for creating Feynman diagrams

*WARNING*: This project is no longer maintained - Since I haven't been able to spend as much time as I wanted,
  part of this codebase started collecting cob webs. Rather than running around with a broom, I have opted 
  to start reworking a few of the core internals. You can track the status of the project [here](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/feynman-node).
